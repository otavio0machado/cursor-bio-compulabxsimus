# Workflow: /refactor-ui

1.  **Analyze Context**: Identify the `rx.Component` or UI code in the current file.
2.  **Load Skill**:
    - Read `c:\Users\otavi\cursor-bio-compulabxsimus\.agent\skills\ui-ux-reflex-premium\SKILL.md`.
3.  **Refactor**:
    - Replace standard colors with Premium Design System tokens (from the skill).
    - Apply **Glassmorphism** depth where appropriate.
    - Ensure meaningful whitespace (padding/margin) using the system scale.
    - Use `rx.cond` for clean conditional rendering if needed.
4.  **Output**:
    - Present the complete refactored code block.
    - Explain briefly which "Premium Tokens" were used.
