# Workflow: /context

1.  **Analyze Context**: Read the current file's code and its existing comments/docstrings.
2.  **Load Skill**:
    - Read `c:\Users\otavi\cursor-bio-compulabxsimus\.agent\skills\documentacao-keeper-bibliotecario\SKILL.md` (O Bibliotecário).
3.  **Update Docs**:
    - If the function signature changed, update the docstring args.
    - If the logic changed, update the summary.
    - If there are TODOs that were done, remove them.
    - Ensure the file header (if any) is accurate.
4.  **Output**:
    - The file with updated documentation.
    - A summary of what was updated in the docs.
